# Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Supervised Machine Learning

In supervised machine learning we feed the model a dataset that we have the asnwers to. The clean dataset will be fed to a model for processing and eventually the model will make some prediction based on the pattern it finds in the attributes of that dataset.

Our dataset consists of rows and columns. Row are called *Observations* and columns are called *attributes*.


## Unsupervised Machine Learning

In unsupervied Machine Learning there is no existing dataset. Basically in unsupervised ML, there is no training dataset and the outcomes are unknown. The model goes into the problem blindly. For example in case of detecting images of humans vs cats.

## Machine Learning Process

1. Collect data
2. Cleanse data
3. Model building. Modeling involves feeding data to mathematical equations.
4. Prediction: Once the model has been tuned and tested, it is ready for use. The idea is that the model should perform well on datasets that has never seen.
