As much effort you spend making things complex and interesting, you should spend making them simple and arguably uninteresting. If you do a good job, I think the work, or whatever it is you’re doing, will, in the end, still be as interesting as you wanted it to be. Only now it’ll be more accessible, and now people won’t turn away because it appears too complex from the get-go.
